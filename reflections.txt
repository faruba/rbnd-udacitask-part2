# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
about 3 h
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
reading ruby-doc. ruby's API is a little weird.
many high order function of array don't pass index to block. Enumerator.each_with_index  ?
not work
`		puts @items.delete_if.each_with_index.each {|item, index|
			delete_index_list.include?(index)
		}
`
using delete_if to implement  delete_multiple  is easy understand . 
but i have to use "-" ,which took me lots of time to find.


delete_multiple is easy.
I want to finished it by just one line,it took me so much time.
without internet, all I got is ruby-doc.


3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
multiple delete  and change priority.
I just pick two from your suggestion

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
API, some syntax.
